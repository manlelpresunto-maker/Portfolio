<h1>Favourite anime according to Keijo (me!!!!)</h1>
<h2>Bestanimes as someone who started watching just 2 years ago</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>The first anime i watched, it might have a sort of generic story, but i just think its so catchy, there are many deaths, sad and shocking moments in ts anime, and dont even get me started on the animation.</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>Also one of my begginer animes, i thiink the first season is just okay and can be kind of boring, but the second season iis entirely just spectacular, covering the hidden inventory and the shibuya incident arcs. there are some sad moments, plot twists and many EPIC fights, the animation is great and the fandom is a bundle of joy!!!</p>
<h3>Chainsaw man</h3>
<p>It's sort of fallen off because of the manga, but it's certainly one of the best pieces of media i've consumed. Again, the animation is just wonderful, the ost, the plot and the characters are so well written!</p>
<br>
<h4>Honorable mention: Bleach</h4>
<p>Im currently starting top watch this anime at episode 16, i really like the ost, the variety of characters and the way ichigo is developing!</p>
